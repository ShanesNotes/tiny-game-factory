The fenced `json` block below is the canonical, machine-checkable thesis. It MUST
validate against `schemas/game-thesis.schema.json` — run
`node scripts/validate-artifacts.mjs --check thesis --seed-id <id>`. The prose
sections beneath it are the human view; keep the two in sync.

## First playable slice

This becomes the spec's order-1 tracer-bullet slice. It is built downstream in
the co-dev repo, never in the factory.

Scope:
- TODO

Explicitly excluded:
- content expansion
- high-fidelity art
- multiplayer backend
- accounts/auth
- meta-progression unless core loop requires it

Bot success criteria (deferred Two-Bot obligations, carried into the spec):
- 60s run
- no crash
- no stuck state
- random vs skilled bot spread measurable

## Taste gates

- G1: Is the primitive loop worth playing again? (pre-decompose, in the factory)
- G2: Art direction (downstream, inside the spec pack)
- G3: Release candidate signoff (downstream, inside the spec pack)

## Kill conditions

- Fails anti-boring gate after two deepen attempts.
- Bot cannot complete loop because of structural issues.
- Dominant move cannot be removed cheaply.
