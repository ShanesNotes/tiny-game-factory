# ADR 0001 — Engine / Profile

Status: proposed
Date:

The fenced `json` block below is the canonical, machine-checkable decision. It MUST
validate against `schemas/engine-profile-decision.schema.json` — run
`node scripts/validate-artifacts.mjs --check engine --seed-id <id>`. The prose
sections beneath it are the human view; keep the two in sync.

## Decision

TODO

## Context

Seed:
Profile candidates:

## Why this profile for the spec's tracer-bullet slice

TODO

## What was rejected

TODO

## Reversal trigger

Migrate or fresh-prototype if:
- bot testing is unreliable
- loop needs capabilities this profile cannot provide
- toolchain overhead exceeds iteration value
- current architecture blocks depth
