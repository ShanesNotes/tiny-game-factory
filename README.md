# game-design

**game-design** is the spec-only discipline repo under game-studio: it produces
depth-gated theses and issue-sliced spec packs, and builds no game (see
[../DESIGN-RECORD.md](../DESIGN-RECORD.md) §2). Formerly tiny-game-factory.

A local-first, evidence-first agentic **spec harness** for games. It fertilizes a
one-line game *seed* into a depth-gated `GAME_THESIS.md`, decomposes it into an
issue-sliced `SPEC.md`, and exports the result as a **spec pack** — a clean folder
opened elsewhere for human+AI co-development. **No game is built in this repo**
(ADR 0006).

This repository is the **design harness**, not a game. It owns reusable doctrine,
prompts, schemas, hooks, and validators. Spec packs are exported elsewhere
(`/home/ark/tgf-games/{seed-id}` by default) and stay free of harness state.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Probe the local toolchain (writes a generated block into the ledger):
node scripts/verify-local-tools.mjs --write docs/toolchain-verification-ledger.md

# Initialize durable run state for a seed (creates ONLY .tgf/seeds/{seed-id}):
node scripts/init-game-run.mjs --seed-id tiny-asteroid-gardening \
  --seed "tiny asteroid gardening" --dry-run     # preview
node scripts/init-game-run.mjs --seed-id tiny-asteroid-gardening \
  --seed "tiny asteroid gardening"               # write

# Or start/resume the guided idea-factory walkthrough:
node scripts/walk-game-idea.mjs --seed-id tiny-asteroid-gardening \
  --seed "tiny asteroid gardening"

# Verify the whole factory:
npm run verify     # lint + artifact validation + guard dry-run + tests
```

No spec pack, engine, or gameplay code is created by initialization. The next
agent reads `.tgf/seeds/{seed-id}/README_AGENT_BOOT.md` and proceeds through the
phases.

## Decompose and package

Use `walk-game-idea.mjs` as the end-to-end seed walkthrough. It initializes or
resumes a seed, writes `.tgf/seeds/{seed-id}/IDEA_WALKTHROUGH.md`, shows the
architectural decision ladder, and previews the decomposition once thesis +
engine decision + `SPEC.md` exist. After decompose authors `SPEC.md`, render the
issue backlog and export the pack:

```bash
# Render SPEC.md into .tgf/seeds/{seed-id}/issues/*.md (dry-run by default):
node scripts/emit-local-issues.mjs --seed-id <seed-id>           # preview
node scripts/emit-local-issues.mjs --seed-id <seed-id> --write   # write

# Export the spec pack (dry-run by default; leakage-gated):
npm run spec:package -- --seed-id <seed-id>                      # preview
npm run spec:package -- --seed-id <seed-id> --write              # export
```

No remote tracker is published by default.

## How it works

`seed → intake (when vague) → toolchain → thesis → design-review → engine-profile →
decompose → handoff → complete`, with `design-review --DEEPEN--> deepen → thesis`
(≤2 attempts, then killed).

State is recorded in `.tgf/seeds/{seed-id}/manifest.json` (the manifest beats
memory). The thesis declares where its depth lives (`design_register`:
mechanics-first | narrative-first | hybrid | world-first) and how it must feel
(`golden_moment`, `feel_targets` — `docs/feel-doctrine.md`), and only advances
if it passes the **anti-boring gate on paper** (register-aware falsifiers + a
16/24 depth vector; feel claims attacked as findings); the `ADVANCE` verdict is
**design-lock**, which opens engine-profile → decompose. The Two-Bot test cannot
run on paper, so it is deferred into the spec as `bot_success_criteria`
obligations the slices carry downstream. An owner-supplied `BRIEF.md` in the run
dir feeds the thesis as intent evidence and the red-team as claims-to-falsify.
See `CONTEXT.md`.

## Status

v0.2.0 — spec-pack pivot (ADR 0006). The factory stops at an exported,
verifier-clean spec pack; building, playtesting, and fun-lock move downstream
into the pack. Legacy v0.1.0 seed runs (which built first slices under factory
orchestration) are archived under `.tgf/archive/` (untracked) and are not
migrated. Per-seed run state is gitignored under `.tgf/seeds/{seed-id}/`. Run
`npm run verify` before claiming done — do not trust hard-coded counts in
archived handoff docs.
