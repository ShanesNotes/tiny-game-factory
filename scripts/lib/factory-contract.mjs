// The single source of truth for the factory's contract surface: the lists of
// skills, schemas, hooks, and fixtures, the prompt count, and the numeric gate
// thresholds. Before this, SKILLS/SCHEMAS/HOOKS were copy-pasted into
// validate-artifacts.mjs, tests/factory.test.mjs, and run-gates.mjs, so adding a
// skill/schema/hook meant editing several files in lockstep — a drift seam.
// Validators and tests import from here; CONTEXT.md/DESIGN.md point to it as
// canonical. Phase names come from the phase machine in run-state.mjs so the phase
// spine has exactly one source.
