# Domain language — Tiny Game Factory

> **This file defers to [`CONTEXT.md`](../../CONTEXT.md).** CONTEXT.md is the
> single source of truth for what the Tiny Game Factory *is* and what every term
> means. This glossary is a quick agent-facing reference for borrowed skills (e.g.
> `grill-with-docs`) that need to ground their terminology. Where this file and
> CONTEXT.md ever disagree, CONTEXT.md wins — fix this file, not CONTEXT.md.

## Glossary

- **Meta-factory** — The durable orchestration harness in `/home/ark/tiny-game-factory/`; owns doctrine, prompts, schemas, hooks, validators, ledgers. It is never itself a game (ADR 0001).
- **Seed** — A one-sentence game idea (or an inherited repo) that the factory converts into a playable, gated first slice.
- **GAME_SEED** — The raw seed input captured at intake, before any compilation into thesis or structure.
- **GAME_THESIS** — The compiled, sharpened statement of intended fantasy and core loop produced by `tgf-seed-compile` as `GAME_THESIS.md`; gate before any engine choice.
- **Core loop / core-loop candidate** — The minimal repeated interaction that carries the fun; a *candidate* is one such loop still competing for proof, not yet locked.
- **First (playable) slice** — The smallest runnable, bot-tested artifact that exercises the core loop end to end (`tgf-first-slice`).
- **Depth vector** — Twelve axes scored 0/1/2 (`schemas/depth-vector`); fun-lock needs total ≥ 16/24 with nonzero Choice, Tradeoff, Pressure, Uncertainty, Mastery, and Replayable Variation.
- **Anti-boring gate (four falsifiers)** — The pass/fail gate before content/art/polish: Naked Mechanics, Two-Bot, Dominant-Move, and Second-Session tests (`docs/anti-boring-gate.md`).
- **Fun-lock** — The commitment point reached only after the anti-boring gate passes and the depth vector clears its minimum; unlocks content/art/polish phases.
- **Prototype lane** — An isolated build track with a disjoint touch set, dispatched 2–3 at a time only under high uncertainty; the parent integrator owns manifest and selection.
- **Branch bakeoff** — Comparative evaluation of competing prototype lanes (`tgf-branch-bakeoff`) producing `reviews/BRANCH_BAKEOFF.md`; the winning *mechanic* is merged, not necessarily the winning branch.
- **Verdict** — A gate decision: depth verdict is `ADVANCE` | `DEEPEN` (name one transform) | `KILL`; branch verdict adds `WINNER` and `DISCARD_ALL`.
- **Manifest** — `.tgf/seeds/{seed-id}/manifest.json`; its `current_phase` is the resumption source of truth. Manifest beats memory — agents coordinate through artifacts, never chat.
- **Execution ledger** — The append-only record of evidence-backed phase transitions for a seed; resuming from a terminal phase requires a ledger transition, not prose.
- **Run state** — Per-seed durable temporal truth under `.tgf/seeds/{seed-id}/` (manifest, ledger, thesis, decisions, playtests, reviews, handoffs).
- **Child game repo** — The disposable, searchable generated game at `/home/ark/tgf-games/{seed-id}/` (declared default, not auto-created); separate from the factory (ADR 0003).
- **Engine profile / ADR** — The scored, reversible engine decision recorded after the thesis as `decisions/0001-engine-profile.md`; there is no default engine before `GAME_THESIS.md` (ADR 0002).
- **Programmer art** — Throwaway placeholder visuals used so the fun question can be answered before any art investment; never counts toward depth or anti-boring passes.
- **Kill criteria** — The conditions that justify a `KILL` verdict — a loop that fails the falsifiers or cannot clear the depth minimum — ending pursuit of that branch or seed.

## Usage rules for skills

- **Write only inside this factory repo.** `grill-with-docs` and other borrowed
  doc skills may create/edit files within `/home/ark/tiny-game-factory/` only.
  Never mutate source, evidence, or child-game repos.
- **Treat seed run state and child repos as read-only evidence.** Read
  `.tgf/seeds/**` and `tgf-games/**` to ground terminology; do not edit them.
- **Keep this glossary concise.** One tight sentence per term; defer detail to
  CONTEXT.md and the linked docs rather than restating it here.
- **Never leak this vocabulary into a generated child game.** Factory terms,
  ledgers, and skill docs stay in the factory (separation is absolute, ADR 0003).
