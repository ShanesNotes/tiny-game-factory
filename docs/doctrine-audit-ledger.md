# Doctrine audit ledger

Exhaustive re-derivation of every design doctrine surface against
`game-studio/DESIGN-RECORD.md` (especially §8 quarantine: TGF v0.1 is
input, not foundation — nothing survives by default). Ticket T04;
SPEC §3.2.

## Universe capture (ticket start)

- **Command:** `git ls-files docs .factory/prompts schemas templates hooks`
  (run at worktree root on base `8a32010f4ef3`, branch `orch/t04-doctrine-audit`)
- **Count:** 83
- **Base:** `8a32010f4ef3` (design `main` post-T03 rename)
- **Date:** 2026-07-10

Dispositions are judgments against DESIGN-RECORD.md, not taste.
Allowed disposition values: `reaffirmed` | `rewritten` | `culled`.
Attic prompts default to culled. ADRs are never edited retroactively —
wrong ones are superseded (0009 → 0010). Schema structural redesign for
`game-thesis` / `spec-decomposition` is dispositioned rewritten and deferred to T05
(content unchanged this ticket).

## Machine-readable rows

Parse rule for `validate-artifacts --check audit`: each data row is a
markdown table line `| \`path\` | disposition | rationale |` under this
section. The check requires every path currently returned by
`git ls-files docs .factory/prompts schemas templates hooks` to appear
exactly once. Culled paths may remain as historical rows; if still
tracked they fail the check.

| path | disposition | rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/adr/0001-meta-factory-root.md` | reaffirmed | Design remains a durable meta harness not a game (DESIGN-RECORD §1–§3); historical paths kept, decision stands. |
| `docs/adr/0002-evidence-first-prototype-search.md` | reaffirmed | Evidence-first search over sunk cost still governs thesis/gate work (DESIGN-RECORD quality bar). |
| `docs/adr/0003-factory-game-separation.md` | reaffirmed | Spec/build separation stands; design ≠ game repo (DESIGN-RECORD §3); paths historical, decision not reopened. |
| `docs/adr/0004-factory-layout-and-skill-packaging.md` | reaffirmed | Layout + skill-wrapper packaging still operate this repo; substance aligns with design-as-discipline. |
| `docs/adr/0005-gate-policy-in-checkers-not-schemas.md` | reaffirmed | Gate policy in checkers not schemas remains studio contract style (DESIGN-RECORD contracts evolution; T05 gates). |
| `docs/adr/0006-spec-pack-is-the-terminal-artifact.md` | reaffirmed | Explicitly retained by DESIGN-RECORD §3 (TGF ADR 0006 pattern stands). |
| `docs/adr/0007-design-registers.md` | reaffirmed | Registers still route depth mandatory axes; design-lock quality model unchanged. |
| `docs/adr/0008-world-first-register-and-seam-slices.md` | reaffirmed | World-first register + seams still valid for place-payload seeds; no DESIGN-RECORD conflict. |
| `docs/adr/0009-feel-doctrine-and-design-canon.md` | culled | Superseded by docs/adr/0010-feel-doctrine-studio-terms.md; not edited in place; banned feel-slang + quarantine (DESIGN-RECORD §5/§8). |
| `docs/agents/domain.md` | rewritten | Studio vocabulary + run-state lists intake (not culled handoffs/ run dir); design/feel/forge terms (DESIGN-RECORD §2–§5; grill-refresh B). |
| `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` | reaffirmed | Local markdown tracker still the borrowed-skill route; production tracking stays local (DESIGN-RECORD §5). |
| `docs/agents/skill-wrapper-doctrine.md` | rewritten | Removed hard-coded tgf-games path; export-only-via-package-spec (DESIGN-RECORD §3 separation). |
| `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` | reaffirmed | Canonical local label set still required for triage skills; no DESIGN-RECORD conflict. |
| `docs/anti-boring-gate.md` | reaffirmed | Paper ADVANCE design-lock remains design's depth gate (SPEC §1 ADVANCE; DESIGN-RECORD quality). |
| `docs/borrowed-patterns.md` | reaffirmed | Operational harvest ledger for scout; empty template still needed. |
| `docs/doctrine.md` | rewritten | Studio design discipline + forge gate (SPEC §3.4–§3.5); intake default entry; revision side-path; asset-library seam; portfolio-at-front-door (ADR 0011); equal-rigor grill/yolo attention lanes + hard stop line (ADR 0012); reference-game canon pointer (audited-only phase-tier + pigeonhole; FUE W2-B). |
| `docs/engine-matrix.md` | rewritten | non-Godot engine decisions remain valid, but only godot-4 packs proceed into forge (SPEC §3.5 / T06 AC6); game feel vocabulary. |
| `docs/feel-doctrine.md` | rewritten | Studio term game feel; feel-slang scrubbed; forge verify pointer (DESIGN-RECORD §5). |
| `docs/game-dev-bridge.md` | rewritten | Bridge retargeted to co-dev/forge + games/ lifecycle; dropped tgf-games default (DESIGN-RECORD §2–§3). |
| `docs/handoffs/antiphon-design-review-HANDOFF.md` | culled | Historical seed-run handoff; process debris, not studio doctrine (DESIGN-RECORD §8). |
| `docs/handoffs/claude-architecture-deepening.md` | culled | Historical mission brief for TGF deepening; quarantine cull (DESIGN-RECORD §8). |
| `docs/handoffs/claude-architecture-deepening-RESULT.md` | culled | Historical architecture-pass result; decision substance lives in ADRs 0001–0006. |
| `docs/handoffs/dolphin-tgf-e2e-RESULT.md` | culled | Historical e2e mission result; not a living doctrine surface. |
| `docs/hooks-and-guards.md` | reaffirmed | 3 design hooks + 8 shipped pack guards still enforce separation and carried obligations (DESIGN-RECORD §3). |
| `docs/initialization-handoff.md` | culled | Historical TGF v0.1 init record; not re-derived doctrine under DESIGN-RECORD §8. |
| `docs/repo-radar.md` | reaffirmed | Scout radar of borrowable primitives still valid operational surface. |
| `docs/source-ledger.md` | reaffirmed | Re-probe list for fast-moving tools still supports probe-before-assume. |
| `docs/toolchain-verification-ledger.md` | reaffirmed | ACCEPT/PROBE ledger still the truth source for agent tool assumptions. |
| `.factory/prompts/attic/P03_BRANCH_BAKEOFF_DISPATCH.md` | culled | Attic default-culled (T04/SPEC §3.2); retired build-phase TGF v0.1 surface, not re-derived under DESIGN-RECORD §8. |
| `.factory/prompts/attic/P04_FIRST_PLAYABLE_SLICE.md` | culled | Attic default-culled (T04/SPEC §3.2); retired build-phase TGF v0.1 surface, not re-derived under DESIGN-RECORD §8. |

| `.factory/prompts/attic/README.md` | culled | Attic default-culled (T04/SPEC §3.2); retired build-phase TGF v0.1 surface, not re-derived under DESIGN-RECORD §8. |
| `.factory/prompts/P01_SEED_COMPILE.md` | rewritten | Thesis compile remains the design entry gate before engine; MAY cite audited reference ids as contrast only — pigeonhole doctrine forbids reference-as-target (FUE W2-B). |

| `.factory/prompts/P00_ORCHESTRATOR_ULTRAGOAL.md` | rewritten | Routes `intake` + `deepen`, grill/yolo attention semantics with yolo hard-stop, auto-originated yolo runs, and G1 brief generation at ADVANCE before either stop behavior (ADR 0011/0012). |
| `.factory/prompts/P02_ENGINE_PROFILE.md` | reaffirmed | Engine decision phase remains; forge gate is export-time not decision-time (DESIGN-RECORD §3). |
| `.factory/prompts/P07_DEPTH_RED_TEAM.md` | rewritten | Paper anti-boring / ADVANCE design-lock remains; audited reference cards supply depth_mechanisms/anti_lessons attack vectors (findings, not depth points) with SKIPPED when empty (FUE W2-B). |
| `.factory/prompts/P13_EXISTING_PROJECT_RESCUE.md` | reaffirmed | Inherited-repo intake still valid; existing projects are evidence not destiny (doctrine + DESIGN-RECORD openness). |
| `.factory/prompts/P14_KILL_RESTART.md` | reaffirmed | Kill/restart after failed deepen is still the evidence-over-sunk-cost exit (DESIGN-RECORD quality stance). |
| `.factory/prompts/P16_REPO_SCOUT.md` | reaffirmed | Scout harvest of primitives still serves design reuse without cargo-cult (discipline ownership test in DESIGN-RECORD §5). |
| `.factory/prompts/P17_VERIFY_TOOLCHAIN.md` | reaffirmed | Probe-before-assume tool doctrine still binds (design needs verified agent surfaces). |
| `.factory/prompts/P18_DECOMPOSE_SPEC.md` | rewritten | Feel first-class + forge-authoring (SPEC §3.4 / T06); optional ext.disciplines (GB01); post-issue fail-fast `spec:package --require-manifest` dry-run (grill-refresh B / ADR 0011); audited reference packaging_lessons + system_bom disposition checklist with SKIPPED when empty (FUE W2-B). |

| `schemas/playtest-report.schema.json` | reaffirmed | Shipped-pack playtest evidence schema still carries bot/human proof obligations. |
| `schemas/seed-manifest.schema.json` | rewritten | Per-seed run manifest remains resumption truth; optional enum'd `design_lane` preserves legacy runs while making new grill/yolo mode, stop line, and origination durable (ADR 0012). |
| `schemas/spec-decomposition.schema.json` | rewritten | Structured acceptance (T05) + asset_requests/lore_refs/capabilities/verify_plan (SPEC §3.4 / T06); optional permissive ext.disciplines (enum validated in mapper per ADR-0005 / GB01). |

## Post-audit additions (not in start universe)

These paths were created by the audit itself and are required to appear
in the regenerated universe list.

| path | disposition | rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/adr/0010-feel-doctrine-studio-terms.md` | rewritten | Re-derived feel + design_canon under studio terms; supersedes culled 0009 (DESIGN-RECORD §5). |
| `docs/doctrine-audit-ledger.md` | rewritten | Exhaustive provenance ledger (DESIGN-RECORD §8 / T04); Slice B rows for ADR 0011 + in-universe rewrites (grill-refresh 2026-07-12). |
| `docs/adr/0012-design-lanes.md` | rewritten | Owner-confirmed grill/yolo attention lanes, equal-strength gates, recorded-question split, G1 seam, and yolo stop-line release contract (2026-07-12). |

## Grill-refresh Slice B (2026-07-12) — front-end wiring truth

Portfolio-at-front-door doctrine + P00/skill/P18 prompt repairs + handoffs cull.
Consult-reviewed; Slice A owns schemas/init/validate-artifacts in parallel.
In-universe rows above already rewritten for P00/P18/doctrine/domain; this
section adds only **new** universe paths. Out-of-universe surfaces also touched:
`.codex/skills/tgf-office-hours-grill/SKILL.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
`README.md`, `scripts/lib/run-state.mjs` (RUN_DIRS cull), `tests/factory.test.mjs`.

| path | disposition | rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/adr/0011-portfolio-at-front-door.md` | rewritten | New ADR: intake default entry, portfolio distinctness, depth evidence/provenance, both consult positions on default-entry (grill-refresh B). |

| `schemas/intake-grill.schema.json` | rewritten | New schema: ten office-hours pressure fields + digest ref as the intake artifact machine surface (ADR 0011 / grill-refresh A). |
| `schemas/portfolio-digest.schema.json` | rewritten | Portfolio memory includes prior theses, parked proposals, lifecycle, sealed human verdicts (UNKNOWN when absent), and honest source/skipped rows (ADR 0011/0012). |

## Design lanes (2026-07-12)

ADR 0012 re-derived the touched in-universe surfaces in their existing rows
above (`docs/doctrine.md`, P00, seed-manifest schema, and run-manifest template)
and added the new ADR row. Out-of-universe implementation surfaces:
`.codex/skills/tgf-office-hours-grill/SKILL.md`, `scripts/init-game-run.mjs`,
`scripts/lib/run-state.mjs`, `scripts/validate-artifacts.mjs`, and co-located
tests.

## FUE e3 (2026-07-12) — reference-game card substrate

Machine substrate only (schema, canon, validator, index). Pipeline cite hooks
landed later in FUE W2-B; pigeonhole doctrine lives in
`docs/reference-games/README.md`.

| path | disposition | rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/reference-games/CANON.md` | rewritten | Shane-ratified membership list for reference cards; substrate for later pipeline cites (orchestrate FUE e3). |
| `docs/reference-games/README.md` | rewritten | Phase-tiered roles + pigeonhole doctrine for the reference-game canon (FUE e3). |
| `docs/reference-games/cards/.gitkeep` | rewritten | Keeps empty cards/ tree tracked until real research cards land. |
| `docs/reference-games/cards/_example.json` | rewritten | Fictional fixture card proving schema/validator path; not research, not citable. |
| `docs/reference-games/index.jsonl` | rewritten | Generated summary index (id/title/genre_tags/register_mapping/status) refreshed by validate-reference-cards. |
| `schemas/reference-card.schema.json` | rewritten | Draft 2020-12 card shape (moat, loop, depth mechanisms, system BOM, status draft\|audited) for the reference-game canon (FUE e3). |

## FUE cards batch Grok (2026-07-12) — draft research cards (8/16)

Eight draft research cards for the Shane-ratified canon. Status remains
`draft` (cross-audit later). Mechanical universe rows only.

| path | disposition | rationale |

## FUE W2-B (2026-07-12) — reference-game pipeline hooks

Phase-tiered cite hooks on existing in-universe rows above (P01 / P07 / P18 /
`docs/doctrine.md`). Audited-only; empty canon → SKIPPED evidence rows; no card
authoring. Out-of-universe surfaces also touched:
`.codex/skills/tgf-office-hours-grill/SKILL.md` (intake vocabulary),
`tgf-seed-compile/SKILL.md`, `tgf-depth-redteam/SKILL.md`,
`tgf-decompose/SKILL.md`.
