# Doctrine audit ledger

Exhaustive re-derivation of every design doctrine surface against
`game-studio/DESIGN-RECORD.md` (especially §8 quarantine: TGF v0.1 is
input, not foundation — nothing survives by default). Ticket T04;
SPEC §3.2.

## Universe capture (ticket start)

- **Command:** `git ls-files docs .factory/prompts schemas templates hooks`
  (run at worktree root on base `8a32010f4ef3`, branch `orch/t04-doctrine-audit`)
- **Count:** 83
- **Base:** `8a32010f4ef3` (design `main` post-T03 rename)
- **Date:** 2026-07-10

Dispositions are judgments against DESIGN-RECORD.md, not taste.
Allowed disposition values: `reaffirmed` | `rewritten` | `culled`.
Attic prompts default to culled. ADRs are never edited retroactively —
wrong ones are superseded (0009 → 0010). Schema structural redesign for
`game-thesis` / `spec-decomposition` is dispositioned rewritten and deferred to T05
(content unchanged this ticket).

## Machine-readable rows

Parse rule for `validate-artifacts --check audit`: each data row is a
markdown table line `| \`path\` | disposition | rationale |` under this
section. The check requires every path currently returned by
`git ls-files docs .factory/prompts schemas templates hooks` to appear
exactly once. Culled paths may remain as historical rows; if still
tracked they fail the check.

| path | disposition | rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/adr/0001-meta-factory-root.md` | reaffirmed | Design remains a durable meta harness not a game (DESIGN-RECORD §1–§3); historical paths kept, decision stands. |
| `docs/adr/0002-evidence-first-prototype-search.md` | reaffirmed | Evidence-first search over sunk cost still governs thesis/gate work (DESIGN-RECORD quality bar). |
| `docs/adr/0003-factory-game-separation.md` | reaffirmed | Spec/build separation stands; design ≠ game repo (DESIGN-RECORD §3); paths historical, decision not reopened. |
| `docs/adr/0004-factory-layout-and-skill-packaging.md` | reaffirmed | Layout + skill-wrapper packaging still operate this repo; substance aligns with design-as-discipline. |
| `docs/adr/0005-gate-policy-in-checkers-not-schemas.md` | reaffirmed | Gate policy in checkers not schemas remains studio contract style (DESIGN-RECORD contracts evolution; T05 gates). |
| `docs/adr/0006-spec-pack-is-the-terminal-artifact.md` | reaffirmed | Explicitly retained by DESIGN-RECORD §3 (TGF ADR 0006 pattern stands). |
| `docs/adr/0007-design-registers.md` | reaffirmed | Registers still route depth mandatory axes; design-lock quality model unchanged. |
| `docs/adr/0008-world-first-register-and-seam-slices.md` | reaffirmed | World-first register + seams still valid for place-payload seeds; no DESIGN-RECORD conflict. |
| `docs/adr/0009-feel-doctrine-and-design-canon.md` | culled | Superseded by docs/adr/0010-feel-doctrine-studio-terms.md; not edited in place; banned feel-slang + quarantine (DESIGN-RECORD §5/§8). |
| `docs/agents/domain.md` | rewritten | Studio vocabulary: game feel, forge manifest, pack root; dropped tgf-games default path (DESIGN-RECORD §2–§5). |
| `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` | reaffirmed | Local markdown tracker still the borrowed-skill route; production tracking stays local (DESIGN-RECORD §5). |
| `docs/agents/skill-wrapper-doctrine.md` | rewritten | Removed hard-coded tgf-games path; export-only-via-package-spec (DESIGN-RECORD §3 separation). |
| `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` | reaffirmed | Canonical local label set still required for triage skills; no DESIGN-RECORD conflict. |
| `docs/anti-boring-gate.md` | reaffirmed | Paper ADVANCE design-lock remains design's depth gate (SPEC §1 ADVANCE; DESIGN-RECORD quality). |
| `docs/borrowed-patterns.md` | reaffirmed | Operational harvest ledger for scout; empty template still needed. |
| `docs/doctrine.md` | rewritten | Re-derived as studio design discipline; forge-manifest emission + Godot-gate (SPEC §3.4–§3.5 / T06); game feel vocabulary. |
| `docs/engine-matrix.md` | rewritten | non-Godot engine decisions remain valid, but only godot-4 packs proceed into forge (SPEC §3.5 / T06 AC6); game feel vocabulary. |
| `docs/feel-doctrine.md` | rewritten | Studio term game feel; feel-slang scrubbed; forge verify pointer (DESIGN-RECORD §5). |
| `docs/game-dev-bridge.md` | rewritten | Bridge retargeted to co-dev/forge + games/ lifecycle; dropped tgf-games default (DESIGN-RECORD §2–§3). |
| `docs/handoffs/antiphon-design-review-HANDOFF.md` | culled | Historical seed-run handoff; process debris, not studio doctrine (DESIGN-RECORD §8). |
| `docs/handoffs/claude-architecture-deepening.md` | culled | Historical mission brief for TGF deepening; quarantine cull (DESIGN-RECORD §8). |
| `docs/handoffs/claude-architecture-deepening-RESULT.md` | culled | Historical architecture-pass result; decision substance lives in ADRs 0001–0006. |
| `docs/handoffs/dolphin-tgf-e2e-RESULT.md` | culled | Historical e2e mission result; not a living doctrine surface. |
| `docs/hooks-and-guards.md` | reaffirmed | 3 design hooks + 8 shipped pack guards still enforce separation and carried obligations (DESIGN-RECORD §3). |
